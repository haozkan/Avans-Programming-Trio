### Requirements
When working on your user story, please keep the requirements, as stated in the documentation, in mind. Each user story has to contain a model, view and controller for the stated functionality. If you need to change the database, please contact Djim as he’s the database administrator.

### Project Tracking
You can plan and keep track of your project by using GitHub Projects, please use this so other people can see your progress easily. The easiest way is to make a To Do, In Progress and Done list.

### Using Git
Every user story has it’s dedicated branch, which you should name after your user story number. You can build you model, view, controller and datalayer in your own branch. Before working on your branch, always merge the develop into your own branch. This way you’re always using the latest approved code, and you can avoid merge conflicts. If you have any questions, please contact Marco as he is the Repository Owner. Always commit and push your work when you stop programming, this way you can always merge the develop without stashing.
